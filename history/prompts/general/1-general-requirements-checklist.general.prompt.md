## Prompt

```
/sp.checklist
```

## Response snapshot

Generated a general requirements quality checklist for the Hackathon project. Created a checklist with 50 items organized across 9 categories to validate the completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of requirements. The checklist serves as "unit tests for requirements writing" focusing on validating requirement quality rather than implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created general-requirements-checklist.md with 50 validation items across 9 categories
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created C:\Users\AY\Desktop\Hackathon-1\general-requirements-checklist.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now customize the checklist for specific feature requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Without specific feature context, created a general-purpose requirements validation checklist
